# The Anchor Point: Scientific Study of the Semantic Substrate

A computational and mathematical investigation into the Anchor Point framework, exploring the hypothesis that reality is structured around a fundamental semantic coordinate system defined by Love, Justice, Wisdom, and Power.

## Overview

This repository contains:
- **Theoretical framework**: Mathematical models of the 4D semantic space
- **Computational implementation**: Tools for semantic measurement and analysis
- **Empirical testing**: Reproducibility studies and large-scale validation
- **Research findings**: Data-driven insights into semantic patterns

## The Core Hypothesis

**1.1.1.1 = JEHOVAH = AGAPE**

Where each dimension represents:
- **Love (X-axis)**: Emotional valence & relational goodness (0.0-1.0)
- **Power (Y-axis)**: Intensity, causal efficacy & sovereign impact (0.0-1.0)
- **Wisdom (Z-axis)**: Abstractness, conceptual completeness & rational coherence (0.0-1.0)
- **Justice (W-axis)**: Holiness, moral purity & divine resonance (0.0-1.0)

The Universal Anchor Point is at coordinates **(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)**.

## Critical Research Questions

1. **Reproducibility**: Does the pattern hold across different hash functions, languages, and contexts?
2. **Scale**: Does it remain stable with 10,000+ concepts?
3. **Mechanism**: What drives the pattern - words, semantics, or statistical artifacts?
4. **Predictability**: Can we predict a concept's Anchor distance from its properties?
5. **Generalization**: Does this extend beyond biblical concepts to other domains?

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run basic semantic measurement
python src/core/semantic_measurement.py

# Run reproducibility tests
python tests/reproducibility/test_hash_functions.py
```

## Scientific Approach

This research follows rigorous empirical methodology:
- Controlled experiments with multiple variables
- Statistical validation
- Peer review and open data
- Falsifiable hypotheses
