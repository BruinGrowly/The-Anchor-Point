SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSION:
--------------------------------------------------
MIXED EVIDENCE: Some tests support the hypothesis while others raise
questions. The framework shows promise but requires refinement and additional
empirical testing.

Recommendation: Re-examine methodology and conduct more comprehensive
validation studies.

NEXT STEPS FOR FURTHER VALIDATION:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Expand to additional AI models (Llama, PaLM, etc.)
2. Cross-cultural validation with non-Western concepts
3. Longitudinal studies over time periods
4. Neurological validation using brain imaging studies
5. Philosophical analysis and peer review
6. Independent replication by other research teams
