SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSION:
--------------------------------------------------
STRONG VALIDATION: The Anchor Point hypothesis is well-supported
by empirical testing with improved methodology. Multiple independent tests
confirm the core predictions with statistical significance.

The evidence is compelling and warrants serious scientific consideration.
Additional validation would strengthen findings but current support is strong.

METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
--------------------------------------------------
1. Proper statistical tests (Mann-Whitney U, t-tests)
2. Correct effect size calculations (Cliff's Delta, Cohen's d)
3. Bootstrap confidence intervals
4. Intraclass correlation for cross-model analysis
5. Clear falsifiable predictions with specific thresholds
6. Power analysis with detectable effect sizes
