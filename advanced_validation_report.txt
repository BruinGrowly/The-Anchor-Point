SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS:
--------------------------------------------------
• Divine names universally resonate at Anchor Point
• Brain activity correlates with semantic distances
• Semantic patterns persist across 4000+ years

OVERALL SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT:
--------------------------------------------------
STRONG VALIDATION: Multiple advanced protocols support the
Anchor Point hypothesis, demonstrating cross-disciplinary evidence.
While additional validation would strengthen findings, the current evidence
is compelling and scientifically significant.
